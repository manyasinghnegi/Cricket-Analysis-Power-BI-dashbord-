# Cricket-Analysis-Power-BI-dashboard-

 Project Overview

In this project, we will leverage web scraping techniques to gather valuable data from the ESPN Cricinfo website, specifically focusing on T20 World Cup cricket data. This data will be processed and analyzed using Python, with the Pandas library employed for data manipulation and cleaning. The project will involve:

- Web Scraping: Using web scraping techniques (with libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests) to extract detailed data from the ESPN Cricinfo website related to T20 World Cup matches, player statistics, team performances, and tournament results.
- Data Processing with Python and Pandas: Once the data is collected, Python and Pandas will be utilized for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. This will include tasks like handling missing values, data normalization, and aggregating statistics to generate insightful metrics.
- Data Visualization and Reporting with Power BI: After processing the data, it will be imported into Power BI for advanced data visualization and reporting. Power BI will be used to create interactive dashboards and insightful visualizations to help uncover patterns and trends in the T20 World Cup data, enabling better decision-making and analysis.
