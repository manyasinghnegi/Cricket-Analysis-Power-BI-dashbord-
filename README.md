T20 World Cup Cricket Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing T20 World Cup cricket data, where we utilize web scraping, Python, Pandas, and Power BI to gather, process, and visualize data. The steps in this project include:

1. Web Scraping 
We use web scraping techniques to collect data from the ESPN Cricinfo website. The data includes match statistics, player performance, team results, and more. Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests will be employed to extract the necessary data from the website.

2. Data Processing with Python and Pandas 
After gathering the data, we process and clean it using Python and Pandas. The data cleaning involves handling missing values, transforming data formats, and aggregating statistics to make the dataset ready for analysis.

3. Data Visualization and Reporting with Power BI 
Once the data is processed, it is imported into Power BI for advanced visualization. The project involves creating interactive dashboards and insightful reports that highlight trends, player performances, team statistics, and match outcomes.

By the end of this project, you'll have a well-structured dataset and a set of visual reports that provide an in-depth look at the T20 World Cup performances.
